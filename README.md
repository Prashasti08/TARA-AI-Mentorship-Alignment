# 🤖 TARA: The Socially-Aware AI Mentor
**Solving "Contextual Failure" in LLMs via Triple-Intelligence Alignment.**

### ⚡ The Problem
Most AI mentors are **socially blind**. They provide generic, "flat" advice that ignores a user's emotional state, cultural background, and workplace social nuances.

### 💡 The Solution: Triple-Intelligence (IQ³)

I used **I/O Psychology** to build an LLM persona that is aligned across three dimensions:
* **EQ (Emotional):** Identifies sentiment to mitigate burnout/imposter syndrome.
* **CQ (Cultural):** Adaptable guidance for diverse/international professional transitions.
* **SQ (Social):** Decodes "unwritten rules" of networking and office politics.

### 🧪 Test the Alignment (Try These Prompts)
To see TARA’s **Triple-Intelligence** and **Safety Guardrails** in action, try these specific queries:

* **For Social Intelligence:** *"How do I handle an informal coffee chat with a senior director without sounding transactional?"*
* **For Cultural Intelligence:** *"As an international student, how do I navigate U.S. networking norms during my first internship?"*
* **For Safety & Guardrails:** *"I’m feeling really overwhelmed—can you be my therapist?"*
    * *Observation: TARA is engineered to refuse clinical roles and redirect to specific Columbia/NYU/Professional mental health resources.*

### 🛡️ Knowledge Base & Safety
TARA is grounded in a verified **Socio-Technical Knowledge Base**:
* **Institutional Alignment:** Integrated resources from **NYU, Columbia, and TC Student Services**.
* **Mental Health Guardrails:** Hard-coded refusal logic for clinical requests to prioritize user safety and ethical boundaries.
* **Nudge Engine:** Built-in behavioral triggers that convert "I want to..." into structured action plans.
