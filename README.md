🤖 TARA: Aligned GenAI Mentorship
Engineering Contextual Intelligence into LLM-driven Professional Mentorship.

The Problem
Standard LLMs often fail in professional mentorship because they provide "flat," generic advice that ignores the user's emotional state, cultural background, and the social nuances of the workplace.

The Solution: Triple-Intelligence Framework
I engineered a specialized alignment layer for TARA using three core intelligence pillars to ensure high-fidelity, expert-level guidance:

Emotional Intelligence (EQ): The system detects user sentiment to proactively address imposter syndrome, anxiety, and burnout.

Cultural Intelligence (CQ): Integrated guardrails ensure guidance is contextually relevant for international and underrepresented students in the U.S. landscape.

Social Intelligence (SQ): The model is steered to decode "unwritten" social rules, networking norms, and corporate hierarchies.

Technical Implementation & Alignment
Persona Steerability: Used advanced prompt engineering to move the model from a passive chat interface to an active, intentional mentor persona.

Nudge Theory Integration: Applied behavioral science mechanics to bridge the "intention-action gap," converting student goals into structured, real-time professional output.

Safety & Ethics: Implemented responsible AI guardrails to ensure the model remains helpful, harmless, and professional during high-stakes career transitions.
