# 🤖 TARA: The Socially-Aware AI Mentor
**Solving "Contextual Failure" in LLMs via Triple-Intelligence Alignment.**

### ⚡ The Problem
Most AI mentors are **socially blind**. They provide the same generic, "flat" advice regardless of a user's emotional state, cultural background, or the nuanced social hierarchies of the workplace.

### 💡 The Solution: Triple-Intelligence (IQ³)
I used **I/O Psychology** as an engineering framework to build an LLM persona that actually "gets it." TARA is aligned across three critical dimensions:

* **EQ (Emotional Intelligence):** Identifies sentiment to mitigate burnout and imposter syndrome.
* **CQ (Cultural Intelligence):** Adapts communication for diverse/international professional transitions.
* **SQ (Social Intelligence):** Decodes the "unwritten rules" of networking and office politics.
