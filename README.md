# 🤖 TARA: The Socially-Aware AI Mentor
**Solving "Contextual Failure" in LLMs via Triple-Intelligence Alignment.**

### ⚡ The Problem
Most AI mentors are **socially blind**. They provide the same generic, "flat" advice regardless of a user's emotional state, cultural background, or the nuanced social hierarchies of the workplace.

### 💡 The Solution: Triple-Intelligence (IQ³)
I used **I/O Psychology** as an engineering framework to build an LLM persona that actually "gets it." TARA is aligned across three critical dimensions:

* **EQ (Emotional Intelligence):** Identifies sentiment to mitigate burnout and imposter syndrome.
* **CQ (Cultural Intelligence):** Adapts communication for diverse/international professional transitions.
* **SQ (Social Intelligence):** Decodes the "unwritten rules" of networking and office politics.

Unlike generic bots, TARA is grounded in a verified **Socio-Technical Knowledge Base**:
* **Institutional Alignment:** Integrated resources from **NYU, Columbia, and TC Student Services** for accurate academic navigation.
* **Mental Health Guardrails:** Engineered to recognize "Therapy" requests. TARA maintains a strict boundary—refusing clinical roles and redirecting users to professional mental health resources.
* **Evidence-Based:** Grounded in validated I/O Psych models to ensure guidance is professional, not just conversational.
