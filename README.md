# 🤖 TARA: Aligned GenAI Mentorship
**Engineering Triple-Intelligence Alignment: Steering LLMs with Emotional, Cultural, and Social IQ**

### 🎯 The Challenge
Generic LLMs often fail in high-stakes professional mentorship because they lack **situational awareness**. They provide "flat" advice that ignores a user's emotional state, cultural background, and the complex social nuances of the U.S. professional landscape.

### 💡 The Solution: Triple-Intelligence Framework
I developed **TARA** (Transformative AI Resource for Advancement) to solve this **Contextual Failure** problem. By grounding the model in **I/O Psychology**, I engineered a "Triple-Intelligence" alignment layer that ensures the model is emotionally, culturally, and socially intelligent.

* **Emotional Intelligence (EQ):** Identifies sentiment to proactively address burnout and imposter syndrome.
    * *Framework: Goleman’s (1995) EQ Model*
* **Cultural Intelligence (CQ):** Adaptable guidance that respects diverse backgrounds and international student transitions.
    * *Framework: Hofstede’s (2001) Cultural Dimensions*
* **Social Intelligence (SQ):** Decodes "unwritten" professional rules, networking norms, and corporate hierarchies.
    * *Framework: Albrecht’s (2006) SQ Model*

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation & Steerability
* **Behavioral Alignment:** Applied **Nudge Theory** to bridge the "intention-action gap," converting student goals into structured, measurable professional output.
* **Model Steerability:** Utilized advanced prompt engineering to move the model from a passive chat interface to an **active, intentional mentor persona**.
* **Responsible AI:** Implemented layered safeguards and ethical deployment frameworks (Bazigos, 2025) to ensure human-centric oversight and user empowerment.

### 🚀 Why this project sets me apart
* **For Anthropic/OpenAI (Alignment):** Demonstrates the ability to "align" a model to a complex set of human values and psychological principles—essential for Constitutional AI.
* **For Google/Meta (Product UX):** Shows a deep understanding of **Human-Computer Interaction** by using Nudge Theory to drive real-world user outcomes.
* **For Roblox/Figma (Specialization):** Proves I can take a general-purpose model and engineer a highly specialized, reliable agent for a niche, high-value audience.
